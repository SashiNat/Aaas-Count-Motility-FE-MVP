# AaaS Sperm Tracker Test Project

This repo is a hands-on evaluation task for candidates exploring roles in developing the Andrology as a Service (AaaS) platform.

## Objective
Build a basic Python tool that can:
1. Load sperm motility videos
2. Detect and track sperm cells using OpenCV (or ML if desired)
3. Classify movement into:
   - Fast-moving
   - Slow-moving
   - Non-moving
4. Output a CSV with per-frame statistics
5. (Bonus) Visualize bounding boxes or trajectories

## Dataset
Two test sperm videos are included in the `/videos` folder.

## Tools You Can Use
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 or any detection model
- CSV or Matplotlib (for visualization)

## How to Submit
- Share your GitHub repo or zip with code + output CSV + annotated video (optional)
- Include a short Loom (2â€“3 min) or README summary of your approach

## Time Allotment
~3â€“4 hours max. Weâ€™re evaluating working knowledge, not a polished product.

Good luck! ðŸš€
